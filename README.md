# DETECTION OF DROWSY DRIVING
* For drivers, a program that detects sleepiness in real time and warns them if they nod off while
operating a vehicle.
* The implementation is computer vision method utilizes a trifold strategy to identify tiredness, detecting
faces, measuring eye aspect ratio (to identify eye closure), and measuring mouth aspect ratio (to detect
yawning).
* used the Dlib package to identify the face and 68 facial landmarks, then found the aspect ratio using
the landmarks, and finally detected tiredness.
* Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, Dlib Library
